# SwiftDialogs
A set of dialog views written in Swift.

## Usage
Each different dialog is dependent on the `Dialog` parent class, as well as the specific Swift and view file. Just import the necessary files into your project and access them like shown in the `ViewController.swift` example.

## Current Dialogs
#### Loading Dialog
Shows a title and an indeterminate spinner to indicate a background process is running.
